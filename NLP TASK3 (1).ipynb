By focusing on the most probable next words, the model might generate responses that are safe and conventional, potentially missing out on more diverse and innovative outputs. The lack of exploration could result in repetitive or less imaginative responses, especially in situations where novel and unconventional ideas are desired.To address this limitation, other sampling strategies like temperature-based sampling or top-p (nucleus) sampling\n","can be employed to introduce more randomness and encourage the model to explore a broader range of possibilities.\n","However, it's essential to carefully balance exploration and exploitation based on the specific requirements of the task or\n","application.If you are in a Jupyter or Colab notebook, you may need to restart Python in\n","order to load all the package's dependencies.
